//Extending JpaRepository gives us access to basic CRUD methods that we don't have to write
    //This includes find all, insert, find by id, update, delete

//JpaRepository takes two generics:
    //-The type of the Entity we're working with
    //-The type of the primary key of that Entity
@Repository //1 of the 4 stereotype annotations (makes a class a bean)

    //NOTE: The method must be named findByXyz
    //where Xyz is the name of the field we're selecting by
